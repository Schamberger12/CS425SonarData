# SonarGraph

SonarGraph is a c++/opengl program that takes in a text file
of Sonar information and returns a colored graph that shows the 
latitude and longitude of a boat using sonar, and the depth
that the sonar device reports back.

# Instructions

Windows:
    In order to use SonarGraph on Windows, have Visual Studio downloaded and
    open SonarImaging.sln, which you'll find in the SonarImaging folder.

    This will only use the default text file: R48.txt

Linux:
    Have glut dev downloaded on your linux machine, navigate to the folder
    titled "UbuntuBuild", open a terminal and type make.

    In the terminal type ./SonarGraph in order to use SonarGraph with
    the default text file: R48.txt.

    If you would like to use a different Sonar information text file,
    type ./SonarGraph [textfile].

    As an example of a separate textfile, I've included R62.txt.
    To use that file, type ./SonarGraph R62.txt

# Contributions

In order to normalize the colors according to depth,
I utilized code written by David H at Stackoverflow.
Link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3018313/algorithm-to-convert-rgb-to-hsv-and-hsv-to-rgb-in-range-0-255-for-both

Otherwise, I used the shell.c file provided by Dr. Bell in order to get opengl up and running.
